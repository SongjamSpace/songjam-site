            Welcome to Songjam (&ldquo;Songjam&rdquo;, &ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;our&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;) at songjam.space. By accessing or using our platform, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;). Please read them carefully.

            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3">1. Overview</h2>
            <p>
              Songjam is a cryptographic voice verification network powered by $SANG. In the age of AI, a voice recording of a few seconds is enough to create a deepfake clone. 'Vishing' or 'Voice Phishing' is a social engineering attack which leverages deepfake voices. Songjam cryptographically secures your voice to prevent these attacks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our platform enables users to verify their voice in the age of AI, own their data through a proto Soulbound Token which evolves with them, and monetize their voice data to researchers or make it available for AI assistants, voiceovers and reader apps.
